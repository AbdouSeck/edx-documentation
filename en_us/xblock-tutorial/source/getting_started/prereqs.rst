EdX repositories, including XBlock and the XBlock SDK, are stored on GitHub.

To build your own XBlock, and to deploy it later, you must use Git for source

Docker
************************

The easiest way to get started quickly with writing your own XBlock is to use
`Docker`_. Docker offers a set of tools to build, run, and distribute
applications in a self-contained fashion. EdX has published a base XBlock SDK
Docker image that anyone can download and run. You can use this to easily
customize your own XBlock and run it in the XBlock workbench.

To get started with Docker, you may use one of the following guides, depending
on your operating system:

* `Docker for Mac`_
* `Docker for Windows`_
* `Docker for Linux`_
