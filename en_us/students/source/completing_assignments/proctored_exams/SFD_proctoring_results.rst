While the data for your proctoring session is being reviewed, your proctoring
review status is in a **Pending** state until a final result is available.
Reviews usually take three to five days.

When the review is complete, you can return to the exam page to see whether
your proctoring review result is **Satisfactory** or **Unsatisfactory**.

This table summarizes the possible outcomes of a proctored exam, and what this
means for your credit eligibility.

.. note:: Your proctoring session review result is separate from the score you
   achieve on your exam. You might receive a **Satisfactory** result on the
   proctoring review, but not earn enough points to pass the exam. Or you might
   receive a passing grade on the exam, but receive an **Unsatisfactory**
   result on the proctoring review.

   * - Proctoring Review Result
     - What It Means
   * - Pending
     - The data from your proctoring session is still being reviewed. You can
       expect results to appear in two or three days.
   * - Satisfactory
     - You have passed the review. If you also achieve the minimum credit
       eligibility grade in your course, you can purchase academic credit.
   * - Unsatisfactory
     - There were either issues with your identity verification or evidence of
       suspicious activity during the exam.

       An **Unsatisfactory** result means that you are not eligible to purchase
       academic credit for this course, regardless of your final grade.

       If you want to dispute this result, contact the course team or edX
       Support.

.. Add the following sentence to "Unsatisfactory" when the feature releases:

.. You also automatically receive a score of 0 for the exam.
