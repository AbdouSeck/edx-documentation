Write short, clear sentences. Avoid dependent clauses.

Break sentences into shorter phrases where possible.

Locate the course you want to re-run, and then click **Re-Run Course**.

Don’t use “the following” as a noun
Don't use "should" for "have to" or "must"; can use "we recommend"

Avoid redundancy in phrases like, 
Create a new NOUN --> prefer Create a NOUN
Delete/Edit an existing NOUN --> prefer Delete/Edit a NOUN

  * - Abbreviations
    - Only use for standards of measurement, such as kb. For example, replace
      "etc." with "and so on".
  * - Active voice
    - Use active voice as much as possible. 

      "These events are emitted by the browser when you click **Save**." 

      "The browser emits these events when you click **Save**."

  * - Acronyms
    - Always spell out on first mention.

      Students see your course in the learning management system (LMS).

  * - Capitalization
    - Capitalize headings. Do not capitalize job titles, such as professor, instructor, or program manager.
  * - Caution block
    - Do not use. Use a note block or a warning block instead.
  * - Cross-references
    - Introduce stand-alone cross-references with "For more information, see
      ``<topic name>``. (Do not use the more abrupt "See ``<topic name>``.")

      For inline cross-references, create links to words in the sentence, but
      don't use the name of the topic itself unless the capitalization works
      with the sentence. For example: "You can use the ``:ref:`course
      checklists<Use the Course Checklist>``` to verify that the course is
      ready for release."

  * - Dates
    - Format dates as DD Mon YYYY or DD Month YYYY. For example: 11 Jan 2015
  * - File types 
    - Include the period before the file type abbreviation, and make the file
      type lowercase. For example: "Download a .csv file on the Instructor
      Dashboard." If necessary, explain the file type. For example: "A Word
      (.doc) file."
  * - Headings
    - *How headings are worded (H1s: gerunds, etc.)*
  * - Images
    - Minimize use of screenshots and other graphics. For more information,
      see :ref:`Images`.
  * - Lists
    - Introduce a list with a complete sentence that ends in a period. See also "steps."

      Use complete sentences with terminal periods in lists unless each item
      is short (e.g., three words or fewer).

  * - Notes
    - Use when you want the user to pay special attention to an instruction or idea.
  * - Numbers
    - Spell out numbers from zero to nine and use numerals for 10 and above,
      even in the same sentence. For example: "You may select five, six, or 12
      users."
  * - Passive voice
    - Do not use unless absolutely necessary. It frequently makes the actor unclear.
  * - Steps
    - To introduce steps, use "To do this, follow these steps." Note the terminal period.

      If you are describing a procedure for the user to follow, use numbered
      steps instead of writing out the procedure as a narrative.

      If you are explaining a problem that occurs, and the problem is
      relatively simple, use a narrative. For example: "When you go to the
      Instructor Dashboard, download a .csv file of your learners, and then
      open the .csv file, you may see incorrect information in the file." If
      the problem is more complex, write it out as steps.

  * - Tables
    - *Rules for use*
  * - UI terms
    - When you describe UI elements, leave out the UI element name. For
      example, type "click OK" instead of "click the OK button."

      If the UI has an error, such as a spelling mistake, write the word or
      phrase correctly in the documentation.

  * - Warnings
    - Only use when a user might have significant problems, such as data loss or a security vulnerability.
