Documenting the User Interface
###############################


For UI elements, everything should use sentence caps except the following
items, which use title caps:

* Page titles
* Tab titles (maybe?)
* Buttons (because these usually only have a few words)


"A browser emits ``seek_video`` events when a user uses the playback bar or back 30 seconds button, or clicks in a transcript, to go to a different point..."
SP: Maybe enclose "back 30 seconds" in quotation marks to clarify it's the name of the button?
AH: it's not the actual name of the button, or I would bold it... how would you categorize this for the style guide?
SP: Hmm - I think since it's not really the name of the button, but describes what the button does, we should use quotation marks but not capitalize it? We should probably have a "buttons that have icons but not text but we need to describe them" category in the style guide. :-\
AH: there are several more UI controls like this, no visible label or mouseover tip/name, including the "playback" bar. When we have a more complete definition of what to do, I'll delimit all of them in this file when we do the globalization review...
