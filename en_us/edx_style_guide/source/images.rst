Because the UI can change rapidly, use images sparingly.

Guidelines
*****************

Guidelines for using screenshots in documentation (when is it necessary)
Guidelines for making screen captures (sizes, resolution, how much of window
to capture/exclude)
Before you take a screen shot, narrow the window to avoid extra white space - usually narrow until page is no longer responsive (unless this will make screen shot too long)

Keep images flush with text in bulleted and ordered lists.

*****************
Capturing Images
*****************

You can use the Mac's built-in screen capture functionality to take screen shots. 

To capture part of the screen:

#. Press CMD + SHIFT + 4. The mouse pointer changes to a crosshairs symbol.
#. Click and drag from the upper-left corner of the area you want to capture
   to the lower-right corner, and let go of the mouse when you've captured the
   image you want.

.. note:: This method does not capture the mouse pointer.

*****************
Accessibility
*****************

Making images and accessible and easy to globalize
use alt text so that screenreaders have information for the image

*****************
Editing Images
*****************

Processing screenshots (colors for borders, overlay items) and how to make
higher res version available

Use Photoshop to edit images.

Screen shots must have a border:
2 pt
#b7b7b7

Save the screen shot as the original size and set size in document.

Save for web (CMD+OPTION+SHIFT+S): 

Preset: PNG-24
Accept other defaults
Save as .png.

=============
Annotations
=============

To annotate screen shots, use edX magenta (#b62364). If another color is
required, use edX blue (#2276b2). 

Make sure that callouts or other additions are in a separate layer from the
images.

instead of using text, use numbered identifiers and provide a legend

if text is used in graphics, leave 30% extra surrounding space for expansion

***************
Image Sizes
***************

Save the screen shot as the original size. Set size in document. This way a
user can click the image in the document to enlarge it.
