Guidelines for using screenshots in documentation (when is it necessary)
Resources for making screen captures (existing dummy course with good data)
Guidelines for making screen captures (sizes, resolution, how much of window to capture/exclude)
Processing screenshots (colors for borders, overlay items) and how to make higher res version available
Making images and accessible and easy to globalize
if callouts or other additions are made to a screenshot, or text added to a diagram, put it in a separate layer from the images
if text is used in graphics, leave 30% extra surrounding space for expansion
instead of using text, use numbered identifiers and provide a legend
use alt text so that screenreaders have information for the image
