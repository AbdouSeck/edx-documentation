EdX has incorporated its technical support for course teams into the edX Partner
Portal. To access technical support, submit a support ticket, and review any
support tickets you have created, go to https://partners.edx.org and select
**Course Staff Support** at the top of the page. This option is available on
every page, so you can access the technical support site from wherever you
are.
