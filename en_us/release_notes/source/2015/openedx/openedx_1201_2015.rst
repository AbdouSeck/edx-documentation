=========================================
TPA Sign In Without Account Activation
=========================================

This release further streamlines the account registration and sign in
experience for learners at institutions that enable third party authentication
(TPA) between an institutional authentication system and an implementation of
the edX platform.

Learners who register and sign in to the edX site with their campus or
institutional credentials are no longer required to activate their new user
accounts by following a link received by email. A reminder message appears on
the learner dashboard until account activation takes place.

A learner who enters an incorrect email address, and therefore does not receive
the activation email message, can correct the email address by selecting the
menu next to their username, and then selecting **Account**.

=========================================
Command Change for SAML Testing
=========================================

The recent edX platform upgrade to Django 1.8 required a change to the
management command used when :ref:`installation:testing an enabled SAML
identity provider<Test an Enabled SAML Provider>`. This command now uses the
syntax ``lms saml --pull`` instead of ``lms saml pull``.

=========================================
Upgrade to Django 1.8.7
=========================================

As a follow up to the upgrade of the edX platform to Django 1.8.5, this release
upgrades the edX platform to Django 1.8.7.

For more information, see the Django release notes for `1.8.6`_ and `1.8.7`_.
