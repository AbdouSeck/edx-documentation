Data for each of your course videos is now available in edX Insights. How many
learners started viewing the video, and how many actually completed it? What
parts of a video did learners replay, and what parts did they skip over? In
Insights, metrics and tool tips provide the exact counts, and a chart helps you
visualize your learners' viewing patterns for each five second segment.

For some videos, the information that you get from Insights might be a valuable
confirmation that your learners are engaged by video content. For other videos,
the information might raise questions about why learners replay, or skip over,
a particular part of the video.

segments of your course videos, make deductions about causes, and take action.
