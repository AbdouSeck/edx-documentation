.. saved for future use, removed from 10-21-15 release

Open response assessments are enhanced in this release to allow course teams to
specify, and learners to submit, additional types of files along with their
text responses. To take advantage of this feature, when course teams add an
open response assessment component to a course, they can now edit the component
in Studio to allow file uploads. Options to specify a set of image file types,
the image file types and .pdf format, or define a set of custom file types are
available.

To protect learners from the transmission of potentially harmful files during
the peer review stage of the assessment, this enhancement also gives system
administrators the ability to configure a list of file types that learners
cannot upload.
