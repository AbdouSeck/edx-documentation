The edX mobile app for iPhones and Android phones can now be used to access
the following basic assessment types.

* Checkbox
* Dropdown
* Multiple choice
* Numerical input
* Text input

Learners should be cautious when they use a mobile app to complete  graded
assignments, as not all problem types are fully supported in the mobile app.
