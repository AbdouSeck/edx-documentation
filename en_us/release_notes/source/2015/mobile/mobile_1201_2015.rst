The edX mobile apps for iOS and Android now provide a much more complete course
experience for learners who access edX courses using these apps. Learners can
now use the edX mobile apps to view HTML and text components, and also to
complete assignments that consist of the basic assessment types (checkbox,
dropdown, multiple choice, and text or numerical input).

For more information, see :ref:`learners:SFD Mobile`.
