The edX mobile app for iPhones and Android phones can now be used to access
the following basic assessment types: checkbox, dropdown, multiple choice,
numerical input, and text input problems. Learners should be cautious in
completing graded assignments using the mobile app, as not all problem types
are fully supported in the mobile app.
