This topic describes features that are in development and that edX expects to
release in the near future. After these features are released, the release
notes will include links to related documentation.

* The edX mobile app for Android will soon provide a much more complete course
  experience for learners who access edX courses using their Android
  smartphones. Learners will be able to use the edX Android app to view HTML
  and text components, and complete assignments that consist of the basic
  assessment types (checkbox, dropdown, multiple choice, and text or numerical
  input).

* Learners will be able to create a bookmark on any course page so that they
  can return to that page easily. Learners will be able to see their bookmarks
  in the learning sequence at the top of the page and on a separate **My
  Bookmarks** page.
