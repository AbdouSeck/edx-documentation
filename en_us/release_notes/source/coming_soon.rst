The following list describes features that are currently in development and
that edX expects to release in the near future. After these features are
released, we will add a link to related documentation.

**************************
Grade Report Enhancements
**************************

Course teams will soon be able to download a new problem-level grade report from
the **Data Download** tab in the LMS. This new report will show the possible and
earned points for each problem in an assignment, the total weighted score for
each problem, and each learner's overall grade.

In addition, the existing grade report will include new columns that show the
following information about each learnerâ€™s certificate status.

* The learner's enrollment track.
* Whether the learner has completed ID verification.
* Whether the learner has earned a certificate for the course (based on
  attaining a passing grade at the time that the grade report is requested).
* The type of certificate earned.
* Whether certificates have been generated for the course.

*************
Student Notes
*************

A new Student Notes tool allows learners in some courses to highlight and make
notes about text directly in the courseware. Learners can see individual notes
in the courseware or all notes together on a new **Notes** tab in the LMS.
