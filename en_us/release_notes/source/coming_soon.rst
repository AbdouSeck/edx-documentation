The following list describes features that are currently in development and
that edX expects to release in the near future. After these features are
released, we will add a link to related documentation.

* Using content libraries, course teams will soon be able to collaborate on
  creating a pool of problems that can be shared across multiple courses from
  their organization. Course authors will be able to add randomized problems in
  their courses that draw from a specified content library.

* Open response assessments (ORA) in edx.org and edge.edx.org courses will soon
  support multiple prompts.
