This topic describes features that are in development and that edX expects to
release in the near future. After these features are released, the release
notes will include links to related documentation.

****************************************
Notetaking Feature for Learners
****************************************

A feature that gives learners the ability to highlight course content and make
notes while they take a course will soon be enabled for all courses on the
edx.org and edge.edx.org websites. Learners who use this feature will be able
to review their notes either in the course content or listed on a new, separate
**Notes** page in the course.

***********************************
LMS Page Renaming and Resequencing
***********************************

A change is coming to the learner experience. Instead of the existing **Course
Info** and **Courseware** pages in the LMS, learners will soon see **Home** and
**Course** pages.

* The **Home** page replaces the **Course Info** page. It will open
  automatically when the learner signs in and selects a course. In addition to
  course updates and news, the **Home** page will feature important course
  dates. **Home** is now the first page option for learners.

* **Course** is the new name for the **Courseware** page. It will be located to
  the right of the **Home** page.
