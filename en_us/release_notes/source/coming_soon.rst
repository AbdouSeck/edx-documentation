Coming Soon
####################################

The following list describes features that are currently in development and
that edX expects to release in the near future. After these features are
released, we will add a link to related documentation.

*************
Student Notes
*************

A new Student Notes tool allows learners in some courses to highlight and make
notes about text directly in the courseware. Learners can see individual notes
in the courseware or all notes together on a new **Notes** tab in the LMS.

****************
Learner Profiles 
****************

Students will be able to create profiles in which they can indicate their time
zone, country, and language, as well as include a profile photo or avatar. In
discussion posts, learners will be able to click other learners' profile links
to view their profile details.

******************************
Insights into Ungraded Content
******************************

Following the release of student performance data for graded assignments a few
weeks ago, course teams will soon be able to use edX Insights to access the
same data for ungraded exercises. The answers that students submit for
questions in ungraded units will be available, as well as aggregated
performance data at the section, subsection, and unit level.
