The following list describes features that are currently in development and
that edX expects to release in the near future. After these features are
released, we will add a link to related documentation.

* Student notes will soon be available in edx.org and edge.edx.org
  courses. This feature allows learners to highlight text and make notes while
  they progress through the course. Learners can review their own notes in the
  course content, or on a new **Notes** tab.

* Course teams will soon be able to use new component types to include Google
  Calendars and Google Drive documents in courseware.
