This topic describes features that are in development and that edX expects to
release in the near future. After these features are released, the release
notes will include links to related documentation.

The edX mobile apps for iOS and Android will soon provide a much more complete
course experience for learners who access edX courses using these apps.
Learners will be able to use the edX mobile apps to view HTML and text
components, and complete assignments that consist of the basic assessment types
(checkbox, dropdown, multiple choice, and text or numerical input).
