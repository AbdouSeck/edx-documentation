This topic describes features that are in development and that edX expects to
release in the near future. After these features are released, the release
notes will include links to related documentation.

The edX mobile app for Android will soon provide a much more complete course
experience for learners who access edX courses using their Android
smartphones. Learners will be able to use the edX Android app to view HTML and
text components, and complete assignments that consist of the basic assessment
types (checkbox, dropdown, multiple choice, and text or numerical input).
