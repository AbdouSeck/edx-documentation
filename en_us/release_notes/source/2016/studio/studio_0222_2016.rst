* A problem that caused a status of "Published, not yet released" to be visible
  for sections in self-paced courses has been fixed. (ECOM-3615)

* The Randomize component is now deprecated and can no longer be added in
  Studio. When you access a course that still uses the Randomize component,
  Studio displays the message “This course uses features that are no longer
  supported.” If your course uses the deprecated Randomize component, you
  should replace any instances with randomized content blocks.

  To provide randomized content, you can use randomized content blocks in
  content libraries. For more information, see
  :ref:`partnercoursestaff:Randomized Content Blocks`.
