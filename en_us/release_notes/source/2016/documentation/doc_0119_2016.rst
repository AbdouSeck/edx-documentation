==================================
EdX Documentation Resources
==================================

EdX publishes documentation on the `docs.edx.org`_ website. Guides are
available to help learners, course teams, researchers, developers, and other
audiences use edX websites and software effectively.

As of 1 January 2016, edX no longer maintains an individual change log for each
guide. These release notes provide a weekly summary of software changes, and
include links to more complete documentation when it is available. If you are
intereated in detailed information about every change, see the
`edx-documentation`_ repository on GitHub.
