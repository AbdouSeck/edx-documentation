<p class="last">Problems can occur when you move your course from edge.edx.org to edx.org, or vice versa, if your course has the same URL in both places. To work around this problem, make sure that the URLs are different by specifying a different university or course number when you create each course. For example, if your university is edX and your course number is edX101, you can specify the course number as <strong>edx_101</strong> (note the underscore) on Edge and <strong>edX101</strong> on edX.</p>

<p>Open response assessments allow instructors to assess student learning through questions that may not have definite answers. Tens of thousands of students can receive feedback on written responses of varying lengths as well as files, such as computer code or images, that the students upload. Open response assessment technologies include self assessment and peer assessment. With self assessments, students learn by comparing their answers to a rubric that you create. With peer assessments, students compare their peers' answers to the rubric.</p>

<p><strong>Open response assessment technology is still in beta.</strong> For a good
experience with open response assessments, you'll need to follow a few
guidelines.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Do not create a new open response assessment in a running course.
Only create open response assessments in a test course.</li>
<li>If your course will include open response assessments, add and
thoroughly test all the open response assessments <em>before</em> the course
is live.</li>
<li>Set open response assessments to be optional, ungraded, or droppable
exercises until you've used the technology a few times and have
become familiar with it.</li>
<li>Use open response assessments sparingly at first. Only include a few
in your course, and make sure that you have contingency plans in case
you run into problems.</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, if you're at an edX consortium university and you plan to
include open response assessments in a MOOC, make sure to notify your
edX project manager (PM).</p>

<span id="ora-components"></span><h2>Components of an Open Response Assessment<a class="headerlink" href="#components-of-an-open-response-assessment" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>An open response assessment has three elements:</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">The assessment type or types--self, peer, or artificial intelligence
(AI). The type of assessment and the order in which the assessments
run appears in the upper right corner of the ORA problem. In the
following example, the student performs a self assessment, then peers
perform peer assessments, and then an AI assessment runs.</p>
<img alt="Image of ORA with assessment types circled" src="../_images/CITL_AssmtTypes.png" />
</li>
<li><p class="first">The question that you want your students to answer. This appears near
the top of the component, followed by a field where the student
enters a response.</p>
<img alt="Image of ORA question" src="../_images/CITLsample.png" />
</li>
<li><p class="first">A rubric that you design. After the student enters a response and
clicks <strong>Submit</strong>, if the assessment is a self assessment, the
student sees the rubric below his answer and compares his answer to
the rubric. (If the assessment is an AI or peer assessment, the
student sees a &quot;Your response has been submitted&quot; message but doesn't
see the rubric.)</p>
<img alt="Image of ORA with rubric showing below the student's response" src="../_images/CITL_SA_Rubric.png" />
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="open-response-assessment-types">
<span id="ora-types"></span><h2>Open Response Assessment Types<a class="headerlink" href="#open-response-assessment-types" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>There are three types of assessments for ORAs: self assessment, AI
assessment, and peer assessment.</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">Self assessment allows students to answer a question, and then assess
their response according to the rubric you created for the question.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">In AI assessment, a computer algorithm learns how to grade according
to the rubric from 100 or more instructor-graded responses, and
attempts to grade the rest of the student responses in the same way.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Peer assessment allows students to score each other and provide
feedback, again using the same rubric.</p>
<div class="admonition warning">
<p class="first admonition-title">Warning</p>
<p class="last">In peer assessments, the <strong>due date</strong> that you set for the subsection that contains the ORA problem is the date by which students must not only submit their own responses, but finish grading the required number of peer responses.</p>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You can use one or more of these assessments in any problem. You can
also set thresholds within the problem for each assessment, so that a
response with a low score in one assessment does not move on to the next
assessment.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="effective-questions">
<span id="ora-effective-questions"></span><h2>Effective Questions<a class="headerlink" href="#effective-questions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>When you write your question, we recommend that you specify an
approximate number of words or sentences that a student's response has
to have in the body of your question. You may also want to provide
information about how to use the LMS. If you require students to upload
a file as a response, you can provide specific instructions about how to
upload and submit their files. You can let students know what to expect
after they submit responses. You can also mention the number of times
that a student will be able to submit a response for the problem.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="rubrics">
<span id="ora-rubrics"></span><h2>Rubrics<a class="headerlink" href="#rubrics" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The same rubric is used for all three ORA types, and it can include
anything that you want it to include.</p>
<p>In Studio, rubrics are arranged by <em>categories</em>. Each category has two
or more <em>options</em>, and each option has a point value.</p>
<p>Options must be listed in ascending order starting at 0 points. For
example, in a category with three options, the first option is worth 0
points, the second is worth 1 point, and the third is worth 2 points.
The person or algorithm that grades the problem selects one value for
each category.</p>
<p>Different categories in the same problem can have different numbers of
options.</p>

<p class="last">After you release your problem to students in your live course, make sure
you don't make any changes to the code for the assessment type and scoring. Changing
this code can cause errors in live courses.</p>
</div>
<p>To set the assessment type and scoring for your open response assessment, you'll
enter code that specifies the type and order of assessments to use along with
the scoring thresholds for each assessment. The code uses the following format.</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>[tasks]
(Type 1), ({min-max}Type 2), ({min-max}Type 3)
[tasks]</pre>
</div>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The <strong>[tasks]</strong> tags surround the code.</li>
<li><strong>Type 1</strong>, <strong>Type 2</strong>, and <strong>Type 3</strong> are the names of the types of
assessments. Assessments run in the order in which they're listed.</li>
<li><strong>min</strong> is the point value the response must receive in the previous
assessment to move to this assessment. Note that you do not define a
scoring threshold for the first assessment, because there is no
required previous assessment.</li>
<li><strong>max</strong> is the maximum point value for the assessment. The maximum
score is the second number in the pair of numbers for each assessment
after the first assessment.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, a problem might contain the following code.</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>[tasks]
(Self), ({5-7}Peer), ({4-7}AI)
[tasks]</pre>
</div>
<p>The problem that includes this code has the following characteristics.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The problem has a self assessment, a peer assessment, and then an AI

<li>The maximum score for the problem is 7.</li>
<li>To advance to the peer assessment, the response must have a self

responses that are very short or that have many spelling or
grammatical errors) to be peer graded. For example, you may
disable the quality filter if you want students to include URLs to
external content - otherwise Studio sees a URL, which may contain a
long string of seemingly random characters, as a misspelled word.
When the quality filter is enabled (when this value is set to

answer the problem. Note that each time a student answers a
problem, the student's response is graded separately. If a student
submits two responses to a peer-assessed problem (for example, by
using the <strong>New Submission</strong> button after her first response
receives a bad grade or because she wants to change her original

separate peer graders will have to grade each of the student's two

<li>Student B gives herself 16 points in the self assessment. In the peer assessment, the response receives scores of 14, 11, and 10. Because the median is 11, the response cannot continue to AI assessment. Student B's final score is 11 out of 20.</li>
<li>Student C gives herself 17 points in the self assessment. In the peer assessment, the response receives scores of 10, 18, and 14. Because the median is 14, the response moves to AI assessment. AI assessment gives the response a score of 16. Student C's final score is 16 out of 20.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that if the same 20-point problem changes the assessment order, the student's final score may be different. For example, suppose the assessment order for the above example changes to self assessment, then AI assessment, and then peer assessment. To move from self assessment to AI assessment, the response must score 10 points. To move from AI assessment to peer assessment, the response must score 12 points.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Student D gives himself 17 points in the self assessment. AI assessment gives the response a score of 16. In the peer assessment, the response receives scores of 10, 18, and 14; the median is 14. Student D's final score is 14 out of 20.</li>
</ul>

<p class="last">Because the assessment order can affect a student's final score, we recommend that you specify peer assessments as the last assessments for ORA problems. If the last assessment is a self assessment, the student can award herself full points for a response, even if the response received low grades from the AI and peer assessments.</p>
