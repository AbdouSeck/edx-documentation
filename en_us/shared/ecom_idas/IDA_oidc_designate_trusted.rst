After you create your client, designate it as trusted. Trusted clients
bypass the user consent form that usually appears after the system validates
the user's credentials.

To designate your client as trusted, follow these steps.

#. In your browser, go to
   ``http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/oauth2_provider/trustedclient/add/``.
#. In the **OAuth 2.0 clients** list, select the redirect URL for the client
   that you just created.
#. Select **Save**.
