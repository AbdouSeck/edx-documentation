Managing Proctored Exams
########################

When you administer a proctored exam in your course, learners might have
questions or concerns about the exam. Usually, you can direct learners to the
FAQ section on edx.org, the :ref:`online proctoring rules <CA Online Proctoring
Rules>`, or to :ref:`learners:SFD_ProctoredExams` in the *edX Learner’s Guide*
to answer their questions.

If learners need accommodations for disabilities, or have a technical problem
with the exam, you work with edX support to determine a solution on a case by
case basis.

.. _Respond to Learner Concerns about Proctored Exams:

**************************************
Accommodate Learners with Disabilities
**************************************

If you need to make a special accommodation to the exam policy for a particular
learner, follow these steps.

.. note::
  Make sure the learner who has requested special accommodations, including
  additional time, does not start taking the proctored exam before edX support
  sets up the accommodation.

#. Consult your organization’s disability services to determine the best way to
   accommodate the learner’s specific needs.
#. Contact edX Support and ask the support team to set up a special allowance
   for the learner.
#. Provide edX Support with the learner’s username or email address and the
   exception to the standard exam policy. For example:

   ``Learner cannot see. Allow an additional person in the room to act as a
   scribe.``

   ``Learner requires 30 additional minutes to complete the exam.``

#. When edX support has set up the allowance, let the learner know that their
   special allowance has been granted.

When the proctoring service reviews the learner’s proctored exam results, the
reviewer takes the special allowance or extra time into account.

.. _Requests for Retaking a Proctored Exam:

******************************************
Allow a Learner to Retake a Proctored Exam
******************************************

If a learner needs to retake a proctored exam for any reason, instruct the
learner to contact edX Support.

.. note::

  When a learner retakes an exam, the learner starts the exam from the
  beginning. The learner must set up the proctoring software, answer exam
  questions, and complete all other steps again.
