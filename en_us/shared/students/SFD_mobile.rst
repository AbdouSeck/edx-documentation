  The edX mobile app is a companion to the `edx.org`_ website. You can use the
  app to download course videos so that you can watch them whenever you want
  to, even without an Internet connection. To access the rest of the course,
  including course discussions, homework, and quizzes, you use a web browser on
  a computer.

  Not entirely. With the edX mobile app, you can download course videos to
  watch when you do not have an Internet connection. When you have an Internet
  connection, you can also read course announcements and content, participate
  in discussions, and do some, but not all, of the problems in your
  assignments. To complete an entire course, you use a web browser on a
  computer.

========================================================
How do I post questions on the discussion board?
========================================================

Right now, you cannot use the app to participate in course discussions. To
read or contribute to the discussions, use a web browser on a computer.

Video Questions
*************************

================================
How do I download videos?
================================

To download videos, you must be connected to the Internet. Select the
"download" icon that appears to the right of a section, subsection, or
video name.

* If you select download for a section or subsection, you download all of the
  videos in that section or subsection.
* If you select download for a video, you download only that video.

To download videos, you must be connected to the Internet. After you download a
video, you can watch it any time.

================================================
How much data will the videos in this app use?
================================================

Course videos are optimized for mobile playback, but watching or downloading
any video can result in heavy data use. EdX recommends using a Wi-Fi connection
if you intend to watch or download a lot of videos. The edX mobile app has a
**Download only on Wi-Fi** setting that is enabled by default to help you avoid
using your cellular network accidentally.

========================================================================
What are the numbers to the right of section and subsection names?
========================================================================

The number to the right of a section or subsection name is the number of videos
in that section or subsection.

.. image:: ../../shared/students/Images/Mob_NumberVideos.png
   :width: 300
   :alt: List of sections with the number of videos circled.

========================================================
What are the circles to the left of the video name?
========================================================

The circle indicates whether you have already played a video. A blue circle
means that you have not started playing the video. A half-filled circle means
that you played part of the video. A gray circle means that you played the
entire video.

========================================
How can I make the video full screen?
========================================

Rotate your phone until the video changes to landscape, or select "full
screen" in the bottom right corner of the video screen.

.. image:: ../../shared/students/Images/Mob_FullScreenIcon.png
   :width: 300
   :alt: Video with "full screen" icon circled.

==================================
Can I speed up the videos?
==================================

You can change video speeds on the iPhone app. While a video plays, select
**Settings** (the "gear" icon) at the lower right, and then select **Video
Speed**.

On the Android app, videos currently run only in their original speeds. EdX is
working on the ability to change video speeds.

========================================
How do I change my download settings?
========================================

#. On the **My Courses** page, select the menu in the upper left corner.

      :width: 300
      :alt: Mobile "My Courses" page with an arrow pointing to the menu in the
        upper left corner.

#. Select **My Settings**. 

#. Change the **Wi-Fi only download** setting.

.. note:: By default, the app is set so that it only downloads content, 
  including videos, if you are on a Wi-Fi network. If you change this setting, 
  you might exceed the data allowance for your cellular plan.

==================================
How do I delete downloaded videos?
==================================
 
#. On the **My Courses** page, select the menu in the upper left corner.

#. Select **My Videos**.

#. On the **All Videos** page, select the course that has the video that you
   want to delete. Alternatively, select **Recent Videos**.

#. At the bottom of the list of videos, select **Edit**. A "selection" icon
   appears next to each video name and at the top of the page.

#. Select the videos that you want to delete. To select all of the videos,
   select the icon at the top of the page.

#. Select **Delete**.
