.. _Checking Student Progress and Issuing Certificates:

###################################################
Assign Final Grades and Issue Certificates
###################################################
.. This chapter will be renamed and expanded to include course wrap-up activities and best practices.

As you prepare for the end of your course, you can send students a :ref:`course
farewell<Course Farewell and Certificates>` email message.

To assign a final grade to each student enrolled in a course, you generate
grades after the **Course End Date** and **Time** have passed. See
:ref:`Access_grades`.
 
The final grades of a student in the course and the grading configuration you
set in Studio are used to determine whether the student has earned a Certificate
of Mastery for the course.

The process of issuing certificates is completed at edX: work with your edX
program manager to schedule a date to issue certificates and complete this
process.

****************************************
On-Demand Certificates
****************************************

If you have a self-paced course, you can allow your students to download their
certificates as soon as they have completed enough of the course with a high
enough grade to qualify for a certificate. For these courses, you work with
edX to create a certificate template and enable on-demand certificates.
Students can then request and download their certificates.

.. note:: If your course offers on-demand certificates, we encourage you 
 to include this information on your course About page, on the **Course Info**
 page in the LMS, and in communication with your learners.

Learners can request a certificate at any time after they qualify. Learners
may want to request a certificate right away, or they may wait until they have
completed the course. For more information, see `On-Demand Certificates <http
