<p>To launch a course, you prepare the course itself, the staff, and the
students. This chapter includes a <a class="reference internal" href="#course-launch-checklist"><em>Course Launch Checklist</em></a> to use as a
model for your schedule of activities.</p>
<p>To help you communicate to the course staff or to all course participants
before the course launches and while it is running, you can send email messages
from the Instructor Dashboard. See <a class="reference internal" href="#bulk-email"><em>Bulk Email</em></a>. This chapter also
includes a set of <a class="reference internal" href="#example-messages-to-students"><em>example messages to students</em></a> that you can use as guidelines when you write your own email
messages.</p>
<div class="section" id="course-launch-checklist">
<span id="id1"></span><h2>11.2.1. Course Launch Checklist<a class="headerlink" href="#course-launch-checklist" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>As the start date for your course approaches, a checklist or timeline of
activities can help you make sure that your course, and your students, are
ready to begin. Suggestions for activities to complete before your course
starts follow.</p>
<p><strong>Verify Course Settings</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Check the course start date and time in Studio. See <a class="reference internal" href="../building_course/setting_up_student_view.html#set-important-dates-for-your-course"><em>Set Important Dates for Your Course</em></a>.</li>
<li>Review the grading policy, and set a grace period for homework assignment
due dates. See <a class="reference internal" href="../building_course/establish_grading_policy.html#establish-a-grading-policy"><em>Establishing a Grading Policy</em></a>.</li>
<li>Confirm that any optional features that you want your course to include, such
as implementing student cohorts, are enabled and configured. See
<a class="reference internal" href="../cohorts/cohorts_overview.html#cohorts-overview"><em>Using Cohorts to Build Course Communities</em></a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Review First Week Content</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Verify that all units are present and published. See <a class="reference internal" href="../developing_course/course_units.html#developing-course-units"><em>Developing Course Units</em></a>.</li>
<li>Check all assignments for completeness and verify their due dates. See
<a class="reference internal" href="../creating_content/create_problem.html#working-with-problem-components"><em>Working with Problem Components</em></a>.</li>
<li>Verify that videos, transcripts, and download links are in place and
working.</li>
<li>Review feedback from the course team and beta testers to be sure that the
content has been thoroughly reviewed and tested.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Welcome Students</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Two months before the course start date, prepare and send a welcome email
message to currently enrolled students. See <a class="reference internal" href="#prelaunch-reminder"><em>Pre-launch Reminder</em></a> and <a class="reference internal" href="#send-bulk-email"><em>Send Email Messages to Course Participants</em></a>.</li>
<li>Compose a welcome message and add it to the <strong>Course Info</strong> page. See
<a class="reference internal" href="../building_course/handouts_updates.html#add-a-course-update"><em>Add a Course Update</em></a>.</li>
<li>Verify that a syllabus and other references are available on the <strong>Course
Handouts</strong> page. See <a class="reference internal" href="../building_course/handouts_updates.html#add-course-handouts"><em>Add Course Handouts</em></a>.</li>
<li>One month before the course start date, prepare and send a welcome email
message to currently enrolled students.</li>
<li>One week before the course start date, prepare and send a welcome email
message to currently enrolled students.</li>
<li>Add an &#8220;Introduce Yourself&#8221; post to a discussion topic. For a MOOC, you may
want to manage the size of the thread by distributing student responses
across multiple threads. For example, you can start different threads for
introductions based on geographical location, such as &#8220;Introduce Yourself:
Europe&#8221;, &#8220;Introduce Yourself: North America&#8221;, etc. See
<a class="reference internal" href="../running_course/discussions.html#running-discussions"><em>Run a Discussion</em></a>.</li>
<li>On the course start date, prepare and send a launch email message to
currently enrolled students. See <a class="reference internal" href="#launch-day-welcome"><em>Launch Day Welcome</em></a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Prepare Staff</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Define communication methods for all course contributors, including staff,
instructors, and the discussion team. For example, set up a course-specific
email address.</li>
<li>Verify that all course contributors know how to record their work, report
issues, and collaborate on tasks.</li>
<li>Verify that the instructors and course staff selected for your course
have the correct role assignments in the LMS. See <a class="reference internal" href="../running_course/course_staffing.html#course-staffing"><em>Staffing</em></a>.</li>
<li>Verify that discussion admins, discussion moderators, and community TAs have
registered and activated their user accounts, enrolled in the course, and
been assigned their roles on the Instructor Dashboard. See
<a class="reference internal" href="../running_course/discussions.html#assigning-discussion-roles"><em>Assign Discussion Administration Roles</em></a>.</li>
<li>Define methods for managing discussions and guidance for discussion
moderators, and distribute to the discussion team. See
<a class="reference internal" href="../running_course/discussions.html#moderating-discussions"><em>Moderate Discussions</em></a> and <a class="reference internal" href="../running_course/discussion_guidance_moderators.html#guidance-for-discussion-moderators"><em>Guidance for Discussion Moderators</em></a>.</li>

<div class="section" id="bulk-email">
<span id="id2"></span><h2>11.2.2. Bulk Email<a class="headerlink" href="#bulk-email" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>With the bulk email feature, you can send email messages to course participants
directly from the Instructor Dashboard. Messages can use HTML styling, and can
include links to videos, social media pages for the course, and other material.
All course contributors who are assigned the course staff or instructor role
can use this feature to communicate with course participants before, during,
and after the course run.</p>

Hello {course name} student,

Great job working through week {number}! As you know, the {course number}
exam is next week. If you missed a problem set, you can still earn a
certificate. Each problem set is worth only {number}% of the overall grade,
but this exam is worth {number}%.

Please read this important information about the exam before you begin taking
it.

* The exam starts on {date} at {time} UTC and must be finished by {date} at
  {time} UTC. Plan your schedule accordingly.

* Be sure that you know what time the UTC deadline is in your time zone. See
  the current UTC time {add link}. No extensions will be given.

* The exam is not timed. You can start, stop, and come back to it until the
  deadline.

* Each exam question allows only one answer submission. If you accidentally
  click "Check", that problem cannot be reset for you.

* The exam covers everything (video lectures, reading, and problem sets) from
  weeks {number}-{number}. If you missed any of these materials, you will
  want to review them before you take the exam.

* You can use the textbook and the Internet to clarify your knowledge of exam
  topics, as long as you are not deliberately looking up answers to exam
  questions.

* Course discussions will remain open during the exam, but anyone who posts
  an answer to an exam question will be violating the honor code and risk
  being removed from the class, forfeiting the certificate.

* If you need to alert the staff to an issue with the exam while the exam is
  open, add a post to the General discussion topic and include [EXAM] in
  the subject line.

* Check the Course Info page periodically. It is the fastest way the
  staff has to communicate any delays, corrections, or changes.

Good luck!

Dear students,

Thank you for making {course number} so much fun these last few months! We

appreciate the effort that you put into this course, and we hope that you
enjoyed learning {subject} through edX. With or without a certificate, you

* If you qualify for a certificate (overall score {number}% or higher), the
  edX dashboard will include a link to your certificate in the near future.
  While you may see the link in a few days, it can take up to two weeks edX
  to generate all of the course certificates.

* As a registered student, you will have access to the lecture videos even
  after the course ends. The problem sets and exams will be removed from the
  course when it is archived.

* The {course number} discussions close on {date} at {time} UTC. You will not
  be able to add to the discussions after that time, but you will be able to
  continue viewing all of the conversations that took place during the
  course.

We hope that you share what you learned in {course number} with your

Good luck on the final exam and beyond!
