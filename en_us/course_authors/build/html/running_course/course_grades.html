access student grades, at any time after you create the course. You can also
make adjustments to student grading for a problem, for a single student or all
students. For information about the grading data that you can access and the

<p>For any course, you can generate grades and then download a file with the
results for each enrolled student.</p>
<p>When you initiate calculations to grade student work, a process starts on the
edX servers. The complexity of your grading configuration and the number of
students enrolled in your course affect how long this process takes. You can
download a report of the calculated grades in a CSV (comma-separated values)
file when the grading process is complete.</p>
<p>For courses with fewer than 200 students enrolled, you also have the option to
review student grades on the Instructor Dashboard. See <a class="reference internal" href="#gradebook"><em>Review Grades for Enrolled Students (Small Courses)</em></a>.</p>
<p>To generate the grade report for the students who are currently enrolled in
your course:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>View the live version of your course.</li>
<li>Click <strong>Instructor</strong>, then click <strong>Data Download</strong>.</li>
<li>To start the grading process, click <strong>Generate Grade Report</strong>.</li>

<p>The chart of a student&#8217;s scores on the <strong>Progress</strong> page and the rows of data
on the grade report present assignment scores in a similar order. However, the
total, cumulative score earned for the course is placed in a different position
on the <strong>Progress</strong> page.</p>
<p>In this example grade report, the indicated student has a current grade of 0.43
(43%).</p>
<img alt="A course grade report with a single student's information indicated by a rectangle" src="../_images/Grade_Report_example.png" />
<ul>
<li><p class="first">On each of the first four homework assignments the student scored 1 (100%),
but currently has a 0 (0%) on each of the remaining three assignments.</p>
<p>Notice, however, that the student&#8217;s current average score for homework
assignments is listed as 0.666666667 (67%): in this course, the homework
assignment with the lowest score is dropped, so this average is over six
assignments rather than all seven.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">The student has a score of 0.75 (75%) on the midterm, and a score of 0 (0%)
on the final.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>On the student&#8217;s <strong>Progress</strong> page, you see the same information graphically
represented; however, the student&#8217;s &#8220;total&#8221; of 43% is on the far right.</p>
<img alt="Progress page for a student also included on the grade report: includes a column graph with the grade acheived for each assignment" src="../_images/Student_Progress1.png" />
<p>The chart on the <strong>Progress</strong> page includes y-axis labels for the grade ranges
defined for the course. In this example, Pass is set to 60%, so at the end of
the course students with a grade of 0.60 or higher can receive certificates.</p>

<p>Students can check their progress by clicking <strong>Progress</strong> in the course
navigation bar. The student&#8217;s progress through the graded part of the course
displays at the top of this page, above the subsection scores. Progress is
visualized as a chart with entries for all the assignments, total percentage
earned in the course so far, and percent needed for each grade cutoff. Here is
an example of a student&#8217;s progress through edX101.</p>
<img alt="Image of a student's Course Progress page with the grade cutoffs legend highlighted" src="../_images/StudentView_GradeCutoffs.png" />
<p>The student can see from this page that edX101 was graded as a Pass/Fail course
with a cutoff of 34% and that the grading rubric contained one assignment type,
called Learning Sequence, consisting of 11 assignments total. Furthermore, this
particular student has only submitted correct responses to two assignments, and
that her current total percent grade in the course is 6%. By hovering over each
progress bar, the student can get further statistics of how much each
assignment was counted as.</p>
<p>Further down on the <strong>Progress</strong> page is a list of all the subsections in the
course, with the scores recorded for the student for all problems in the
course. Here is the <strong>Progress</strong> page for the student in the example above:</p>

<span id="id2"></span><h2>12.9.5. Adjust Grades<a class="headerlink" href="#adjust-grades" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>If you modify a problem or its settings after students have attempted to answer
it, student grades can be affected. For information about making changes to
problems in Studio, see <a class="reference internal" href="../creating_content/create_problem.html#modifying-a-released-problem"><em>Modifying a Released Problem</em></a>.</p>
<p>To recalculate the grades of affected students when a correction or other
change is unavoidable, you can make the following adjustments.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Rescore the submitted answer to reevaluate student work on the problem. You
can rescore a problem for a single student or for all of the students
enrolled in the course. See <a class="reference internal" href="#rescore"><em>Rescore Student Submissions for a Problem</em></a>.</li>
<li>Reset the number of times a student has attempted to answer the problem to
zero so that the student can try again. You can reset the number of attempts
for a single student or for all of the students enrolled in the course. See
<a class="reference internal" href="#reset-attempts"><em>Reset Student Attempts for a Problem</em></a>.</li>
<li>Delete a student&#8217;s database history, or &#8220;state&#8221;, completely for the problem.
You can only delete student state for one student at a time. For example, you
realize that a problem needs to be rewritten after only a few of your
students have answered it. To resolve this situation, you rewrite the problem
and then delete student state for the affected students only so that they can
try again. See <a class="reference internal" href="#delete-state"><em>Delete Student State for a Problem</em></a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>To make adjustments to student grades, you need the unique location identifier
of the modified problem. See <a class="reference internal" href="#find-url"><em>Find the Unique Location Identifier for a Problem</em></a>.</p>
