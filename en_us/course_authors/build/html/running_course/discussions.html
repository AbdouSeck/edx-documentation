<span id="discussions"></span><h1>12.3. Managing Course Discussions<a class="headerlink" href="#managing-course-discussions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Discussions, or discussion forums, foster interaction among your students and
between students and course staff. You can set up different topics to guide
these interactions when you create your course, and then run and moderate
discussions throughout the course to encourage participation and develop course
community.</p>
<p>Discussions are also excellent sources of feedback and ideas for the future.</p>
<p>For options you can use to run and moderate discussions, see the following
sections:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><a class="reference internal" href="#overview-discussions"><em>Overview</em></a></li>
<li><a class="reference internal" href="#organizing-discussions"><em>Set Up Discussion Topics for Your Course</em></a></li>

<li><a class="reference internal" href="#close-discussions"><em>Close Discussions</em></a></li>
</ul>
<p>For information about how enabling the cohort feature for a course affects
options for moderating course discussions, see <a class="reference internal" href="../cohorts/cohorts_discussions.html#moderating-discussions-for-cohorts"><em>Managing Discussions in a Course with Student Cohorts</em></a>.</p>
<div class="section" id="overview">
<span id="overview-discussions"></span><h2>12.3.1. Overview<a class="headerlink" href="#overview" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Students and staff use course discussions to share ideas, exchange views,
consider different viewpoints, and ask questions. In a discussion, there are
three hierarchical levels of interaction.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>A <em>post</em> is the first level of interaction. A post opens a new subject. Posts
are often posed as questions, either to start a conversation or to surface an
issue that requires some action. When you add a post, you categorize it as a <strong>Question</strong> or as a <strong>Discussion</strong>.</li>
<li>A <em>response</em> is the second level of interaction. A response is a reply made
directly to a post to provide a solution or continue the conversation.</li>
<li>A <em>comment</em> is the third level of interaction. A comment is often a
clarification or side note made to a specific response, rather than to the
post as a whole.</li>
</ul>
<p>The dialogue created by a post, its responses, and the comments on those
responses is sometimes called a thread.</p>
<p>All course staff members and enrolled students can add posts, responses, and
comments, and view all of the posts, responses, and comments made by other
course participants. Members of the course community, both staff and students,
can be given permission to moderate or administer course discussions through a
set of discussion administration roles. Discussion threads are saved as part of
the course history.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">The <a class="reference internal" href="discussions_students.html#discussions-for-students-and-staff"><em>Participating in Course Discussions</em></a> chapter describes features that
are available to all discussion participants, and may be useful to students
who are new to online discussion forums. You can share the chapter with your
students by, for example, adding a &#8220;Never Used a Discussion Forum Before?&#8221;
post that includes the information you think will be most useful to them.</p>

<span id="organizing-discussions"></span><h2>12.3.2. Set Up Discussion Topics for Your Course<a class="headerlink" href="#set-up-discussion-topics-for-your-course" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Discussions in an edX course include both the specific topics that you add to
course units as discussion components, and broader forums on course-wide areas
of interest, such as &#8220;Feedback&#8221;, &#8220;Troubleshooting&#8221;, or &#8220;Technical Help&#8221;. You
add both types of topics in Studio.</p>
<div class="section" id="add-units-with-a-discussion-component">
<h3>12.3.2.1. Add Units With a Discussion Component<a class="headerlink" href="#add-units-with-a-discussion-component" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Typically, all units are added during the design and creation of your course in
Studio. To add a discussion topic to a unit, you add a discussion component.
Follow the instructions in <a class="reference internal" href="../creating_content/create_discussion.html#working-with-discussion-components"><em>Working with Discussion Components</em></a>. The
result is a content-specific discussion topic.</p>
<p>This type of discussion topic is subject to the release date of the section
that contains it. Students cannot contribute to these discussion topics until
that date.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">In courses that include the cohort feature, all of the
content-specific discussion topics are divided by cohort. Student posts to
these topics can only be read, and responded to, by members of the same cohort
group. See <a class="reference internal" href="../cohorts/cohorts_overview.html#cohorts-overview"><em>Using Cohorts to Build Course Communities</em></a>.</p>

<span id="create-coursewide-discussion-topics"></span><h3>12.3.2.2. Create Course-Wide Discussion Topics<a class="headerlink" href="#create-course-wide-discussion-topics" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>All courses include a page named <strong>Discussion</strong>. When you create a course, a
discussion topic named &#8220;General&#8221; is available for you to include by default.
You can add more course-wide discussion topics to guide how students share and
find information during your course. Such course-wide topics might include
Feedback, Troubleshooting, or Technical Help. Discussions in these topics can
begin as soon as your course is available.</p>
<p>To create a course-wide discussion topic:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Open your course in Studio.</li>
<li>Select <strong>Settings</strong>, then <strong>Advanced Settings</strong>.</li>
<li>Scroll down to the <strong>Discussion Topic Mapping</strong> policy key. By default, its
value is:</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<div><img alt="Policy value of {&quot;General&quot;: {&quot;id&quot;: &quot;i4x-edX-Open-edx_demo_course&quot;}}" src="../_images/Discussion_Add_initial.png" />
</div></blockquote>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="4">
<li>Copy the three lines provided for the General topic and paste
them above the closing brace character (<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">}</span></tt>):</li>

<p class="last">The course team that you set up in Studio (or the course staff and
instructors you add on the Instructor Dashboard) are not automatically
granted discussion administration roles. Discussion administration roles must
be explicitly granted to members of the course team for them to moderate or

access (Studio), and Instructors (Instructor Dashboard) can grant discussion
administration roles</p>
</div>
<p>Different options for working with discussions are available through
these roles:</p>
<ul class="simple">

<li><em>Discussion community TAs</em> have the same options for working with discussions
as moderators. Posts made by community TAs are marked as &#8220;By: Community TA&#8221;
in the list of posts on the <strong>Discussion</strong> page. Responses and comments made
by community TAs have a colored &#8220;Community TA&#8221; identifier. This role is often

</ul>
<ul class="simple">
<li><em>Discussion admins</em> have the same options for working with discussions as
moderators, and their posts, responses, and comments have the same &#8220;Staff&#8221;

moderate discussions and give other users these discussion management roles

<span id="running-discussions"></span><h2>12.3.4. Run a Discussion<a class="headerlink" href="#run-a-discussion" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>On an ongoing basis, the members of your discussion team run the course
discussion by making contributions, endorsing responses, marking answers as
correct, and guiding student messages into pertinent threads. Techniques that
you can use throughout your course to make discussions successful follow.</p>
<div class="section" id="use-conventions-in-discussion-subjects">
<h3>12.3.4.1. Use Conventions in Discussion Subjects<a class="headerlink" href="#use-conventions-in-discussion-subjects" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>To identify certain types of messages and make them easier to find, you can
define a set of standard tags to include in the subject of a post or in the
body of a response or comment. Examples follow.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Use &#8220;[OFFICIAL]&#8221; at the start of announcements about changes to the course.</li>
<li>Provide information about corrected errors with a subject that begins
&#8220;[ERRATA]&#8221;.</li>
<li>Direct students to use &#8220;[STAFF]&#8221; in the subject of each post that needs the
attention of a course staff member.</li>
</ul>
<p>Both your discussion team and your students can use tags like these to search
the discussions more effectively.</p>
<p>When a post is created its type must be selected: either &#8220;question&#8221; or
&#8220;discussion&#8221;. Members of the discussion team should be thoughtful when
selecting the type for their posts, and encourage students to do the same. See
<a class="reference internal" href="#find-question-posts-and-discussion-posts"><em>Find Questions and Discussions</em></a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="seed-discussion-topics">
<h3>12.3.4.2. Seed Discussion Topics<a class="headerlink" href="#seed-discussion-topics" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>To help students learn how to get the most out of course discussions, and find
the best discussion topic to use for their questions and conversations, you can
seed discussion topics by adding posts before your course starts. Some examples
follow.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>In the General topic (which is included in every course by default), add an
[INTRO] post to initiate a thread for student and staff introductions.</li>
<li>For each topic that you create, add the first post to it to describe
the way you intend it to be used. In addition to providing guidance, these
initial messages can also act as models for students to follow when they
create their own posts.</li>
<li>If you include discussion components along with problem components in a unit,
you can add a post that encourages students to use the topic to ask for help
with the problems, but reminds them not to post the answers.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="minimize-thread-proliferation">
<h3>12.3.4.3. Minimize Thread Proliferation<a class="headerlink" href="#minimize-thread-proliferation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>To encourage longer, threaded discussions rather than many similar, separate
posts, the discussion team can use these techniques. However, be aware that
long threads (with more than 200 responses and comments) can be difficult to
read, and can therefore result in an unsatisfactory experience in the
discussion.</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">Pin a post. Pinning a post makes it appear at the top of the list of posts on
the <strong>Discussion</strong> page. As a result, it is more likely that students will
see and respond to pinned posts. You can write your own post and then pin it,
or pin a post by any author. Select the &#8220;More&#8221; icon and then <strong>Pin</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><img alt="Image of the pin icon for discussion posts" src="../_images/Pin_Discussion.png" />
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Endorse a response. Endorsing a response indicates that it provides value to
the discussion. Click the &#8220;check mark&#8221; (or tick mark) icon for the response.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><img alt="Image of the Endorse button for discussion posts" src="../_images/Endorse_Discussion.png" />
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Mark a question as answered. You use the same procedure to mark a response as
the correct answer to a question as you do to endorse contributions to a
discussion: click the &#8220;check mark&#8221; (or tick mark) icon for correct answers.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Close a post. You can respond to a redundant post by (optionally) pasting in
a link to the post that you prefer students to contribute to, and prevent
further interaction by closing the post. Select the &#8220;More&#8221; icon and then
<strong>Close</strong> to close it.</p>

<span id="moderating-discussions"></span><h2>12.3.5. Moderate Discussions<a class="headerlink" href="#moderate-discussions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The members of a course discussion team monitor discussions and keep them
productive. They can also collect information, such as areas of particular
confusion or interest, and relay it to the course staff.</p>
<p>Developing and sustaining a positive discussion culture requires that
sufficient moderator time is dedicated to reviewing and responding to
discussions. Keeping up-to-date with a large MOOC forum requires a commitment
of 5 or more hours per week, and involves reading threads, replying to and
editing posts, and communicating with the rest of the discussion team and
course staff.</p>
<p>For information on setting up moderators for your course, see

<p>You can develop a set of best practices for discussion participation and make
them available to students as a course handout file or on a defined page in
your course. These guidelines can define your expectations and optionally
introduce features of edX discussions.</p>
<p>You can also share the <a class="reference internal" href="discussions_students.html#discussions-for-students-and-staff"><em>Participating in Course Discussions</em></a> chapter with

<h3>12.3.5.2. Develop a Positive Discussion Culture<a class="headerlink" href="#develop-a-positive-discussion-culture" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Discussion monitors can cultivate qualities in their own discussion
interactions to make their influence positive and their time productive.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Encourage quality contributions: thank students whose posts have a positive
impact and who answer questions.</li>
<li>Check links, images, and videos in addition to the text of each message. Edit
offensive or inappropriate posts quickly, and explain why.</li>
<li>Review posts with a large number of votes and recognize &#8220;star posters&#8221;
publicly and regularly.</li>
<li>Stay on topic yourself: before responding to a post, be sure to read it
completely.</li>
<li>Maintain a positive attitude. Acknowledge problems and errors without
assigning blame.</li>
<li>Provide timely responses. More time needs to be scheduled for answering
discussion questions when deadlines for homework, quizzes, and other
milestones approach.</li>
<li>Discourage redundancy: before responding to a post, search for similar posts.
Make your response to the most pertinent or active post and then copy its URL
and use it to respond to the redundant threads.</li>
<li>Publicize issues raised in the discussions: add questions and their answers
to an FAQ topic, or announce them on the Course Info page.</li>

conversation (a discussion).</p>
<p>On the <strong>Discussion</strong> page, a question mark image identifies posts that ask
