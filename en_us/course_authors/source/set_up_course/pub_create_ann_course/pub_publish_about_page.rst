After the course team has :ref:`finalized the course run <Pub Finalize a Course
Run>`, the edX publisher creates a preview of the course run About page. The
course team reviews the About page preview and accepts or declines the preview.

* If the course team accepts the preview, the edX publisher publishes the About
  page on edx.org.

  PC to make any necessary changes. The edX publisher then creates a new About
  page preview for the course team to review.
