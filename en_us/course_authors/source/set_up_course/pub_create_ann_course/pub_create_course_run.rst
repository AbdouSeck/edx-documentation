##################################

In Publisher, a course contains the following information. Most of this
information is required before edX can publish an About page for your course.

.. note::
 Course information remains true for every run of the course. Course run
 information changes each time the course is run.

* Start and end date
* Certificate types and price
* Course staff
* Estimated effort
* Course content, video, and transcript languages
* Course length (in weeks)

.. note::
 Course certificates are associated with course runs. However, you configure
 course certificates in Studio.





The process of creating a course in Publisher includes the following steps.

#. :ref:`The course team creates the course run<Pub Create a Course Run>`. In this
   step, the course team provides only a small amount of information.
#. The edX PC creates a Studio URL for the course run.
#. :ref:`The course team edits the course run <Pub Edit a Course Run>`, adding all
   required information.
#. :ref:`The course team sends the course run to the edX PC for review <Pub Send a
   Course for SEO Review>`.
#. The edX PC reviews the course, then returns the course to the
   course team with any feedback in tracked changes.
#. :ref:`The course team reviews the edX marketing feedback and finalizes the
   course <Pub Review Changes and Finalize the Course>`.
