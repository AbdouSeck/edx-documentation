Online Proctoring Rules for Learners
####################################

EdX.org uses an online :ref:`proctoring<CA_ProctoredExams>` service for certain
exams (typically final exams) in courses that allow learners to earn academic
credit. By default, all learners must adhere to the following rules for
proctored exams. A link to these rules is visible to learners on the
instructions page at the beginning of every proctored exam.

Learners who do not adhere to the exam rules receive an **Unsatisfactory**
result for their proctoring review.

.. Uncommment and add to preceding paragraph when feature is live:
.. Learners also automatically receive a grade of 0 for the exam.

If you have entered different rules for your exam, such as allowing learners to
use a calculator or reference book, these rules are also visible on the
instructions page for every proctored exam. For more information about entering
rules, see :ref:`specifying_exam_rules_and_exceptions`.

.. note::
   Learners who require additional time or any specific accommodations are
   asked to contact their course teams or edX Support. For information about
   handling special requests for proctored exams, see :ref:`Respond to Learner
   Concerns about Proctored Exams` and
   :ref:`specifying_exam_rules_and_exceptions`.
