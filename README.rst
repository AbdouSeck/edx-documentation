EdX Documentation
###################

The edx-documentation repo contains source files for most of the documentation
for edX partners and the Open edX community. This repo is managed by the edX
Documentation team.

API documentation that includes docstrings from code files is stored in the
repository of that module.

Documentation for developers, researchers, course staff, and students is
located in the language-specific subdirectories.
